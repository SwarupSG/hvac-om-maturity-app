maturity_definitions = {
    "Reactive": (
        "Operations and maintenance are driven by complaints, equipment breakdowns, or ad-hoc inspections. "
        "There is no structured approach to fault resolution or verification. Faults may go unrecorded, "
        "and corrective actions are undocumented. Visibility is minimal, roles are unclear, and governance is absent."
    ),
    "Self Aware": (
        "Basic awareness of issues begins to take shape through checklists, logs, or manual inspections. "
        "Faults are captured inconsistently and often resolved without follow-up. Some data is available, "
        "but there is no system to link faults to root causes or outcomes. Oversight is informal, and coordination is limited."
    ),
    "Forward Thinking": (
        "O&M activities are linked to operational priorities such as energy efficiency, comfort, and cost control. "
        "Faults and corrective actions are consistently tracked. Workflows are defined across internal teams and vendors, "
        "enabling better collaboration and repeatability. Data is used for decisions, and governance structures begin to ensure accountability."
    ),
    "Pioneering": (
        "O&M is proactive, structured, and outcome-driven. All faults are captured and resolved through guided workflows, "
        "regardless of data availability. Manual and automated inputs converge into a unified resolution framework. "
        "Governance is embedded in daily operations through role-based accountability, real-time tracking, and predictive insights. "
        "Knowledge is captured, reused, and drives continuous improvement, making the building future-ready."

# Define descriptions for each dimension and level
descriptions = {
    "Governance": [
        "Service providers operate independently with no formal oversight or tracking.",
        "SLAs exist but are weakly enforced; reporting is inconsistent and lacks connection to business priorities.",
        "Governance supported by role-based responsibilities, digital tracking, and shared dashboards.",
        "Governance is fully embedded across teams through live tracking, structured workflows, and outcome-based oversight."
    ],
    "Outcome Alignment": [
        "No alignment between O&M tasks and business outcomes like energy, comfort, or cost control.",
        "Metrics are reported but rarely drive decisions; priorities remain reactive.",
        "Performance data starts informing task selection and team priorities.",
        "O&M efforts are prioritized based on strategic business drivers‚Äîenergy efficiency, tenant satisfaction, and operational cost savings."
    ],
    "Fault Detection": [
        "Faults are only addressed after breakdowns or complaints; no structured detection.",
        "Manual inspections exist but are fragmented; alerts are not consistently logged or followed through.",
        "Fault detection includes FDD and manual methods, but insights are siloed with no unified resolution path.",
        "All faults‚Äîmanual or automated‚Äîare captured through a unified platform, with clear categorization and root-cause validation."
    ],
    "Knowledge Capture": [
        "No systematic capture of operational knowledge; problem-solving depends on individual expertise.",
        "Resolution notes are captured inconsistently and often lost with staff turnover.",
        "Knowledge is structured into fault categories and reused to guide future diagnostics and training.",
        "Knowledge is embedded in workflows and evolves dynamically‚Äîfueling AI, technician support, and continuous improvement."
    ],
    "Process Structure": [
        "No formal workflows; tasks vary by urgency or technician preference.",
        "Some standard checklists exist but are inconsistently applied across teams and vendors.",
        "Digital workflows and mobile tasking ensure consistency, accountability, and repeatability.",

        "Use tracked metrics to prioritize work across internal teams and vendors.",
        "Regularly review outcomes and link KPIs to fault and maintenance workflows.",
        "Dynamically align task selection with business goals using analytics and predictive insights."

        "Encourage fault logging culture‚Äîuse inspections and manual observations to surface issues.",
        "Centralize all fault inputs into one system for tracking and pattern recognition.",
        "Unify BMS, IoT, and manual detection using a structured cause-based framework.",
        "Ensure all faults and root causes are validated, even when automated data is unavailable."
    ],
    "Knowledge Capture": [
        "Introduce resolution logs and guided fault templates to capture site-level insights.",
        "Structure captured knowledge into reusable categories; support onboarding and triage with real examples.",
        "Use captured data in mobile workflows to guide real-time decisions and optimize training.",
        "Leverage insights from every resolution to build AI-ready knowledge bases."

    "Process Structure": [
        "Standardize key tasks and responsibilities with simple workflows.",
        "Enable mobile execution and reporting for all teams and vendors.",
