# 🔧 HVAC O&M Maturity Diagnostic Tool Across Five Capability Dimensions  
# Governance | Outcome Alignment | Fault Detection | Knowledge Capture | Process Structure

# Define descriptions for each dimension and level
descriptions = {
    "Governance": [
        "Service providers self-govern with no oversight or accountability.",
        "SLAs and KPIs are defined but not consistently enforced; SLAs don’t clearly link with business priorities and outcomes desired; service providers largely self-govern with limited oversight or accountability.",
        "Accountability supported by real-time tracking and shared reporting.",
        "Fully transparent tracking of all preselected high-priority O&M activities, with a proven link to desired outcomes."
    ],
    "Outcome Alignment": [
        "No link between O&M activity and building performance goals.",
        "Metrics are tracked for reporting, but rarely used for action. There is no clear link between metrics and operational outcomes, and no prioritization of effort based on performance goals.",
        "Metrics are reviewed regularly and begin to inform decisions. There is an emerging link between operational KPIs and business outcomes, enabling prioritization and more consistent follow-through.",
        "O&M priorities and actions are selected based on desired business outcomes, then configured into an operating framework that drives governance, fault detection, and knowledge capture."
    ],
    "Fault Detection": [
        "Reactive only; faults noticed after complaints or breakdowns.",
        "Manual inspections and basic alerts provide partial visibility.",
        "FDD exists but limited by data gaps; manual inspections operate separately. No unified fault view.",
        "All detection methods (manual inspection & automated FDD engines) converge into one system; validation and escalation workflow included."
    ],
    "Knowledge Capture": [
        "No capture of building’s operational knowledge. Learning is individual and not retained or reused.",
        "Operational knowledge is captured informally, often by individuals or vendors. No structured method for reuse.",
        "Knowledge is captured during fault resolution and reused for similar cases. Reuse informs training and triage. Mobile interfaces support field capture and retrieval.",
        "Embedded in workflows. All resolutions and insights are systematically captured and reused to guide fault response, inform technician decisions, and continuously improve training."
    ],
    "Process Structure": [
        "No formal process; actions vary by person and urgency.",
        "Some processes exist but are inconsistently applied across teams.",
        "Digital workflows improve consistency, guided by mobile apps for reporting and resolution management.",

        "Connect knowledge capture to mobile workflows. Reuse insights to improve resolution speed and training.",
        "Feed captured knowledge into continuous learning systems and advanced technician support tools."

        "Create standard O&M checklists and assign responsibilities to promote consistency.",
